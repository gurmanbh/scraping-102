We start with the basics.

Here is a refresher - 

* You start with `npm init`. That creates a `package.json` file. 
* After that, you can install multiple modules as per your need. For scraping, we are using `request` and `cheerio`. So you run
    `npm install --save request cheerio`
    
    The `--save` flag adds the modules to your `package.json` file for future use.
